        <h2> <strong> The most creamy risotto you have ever tasted </strong> </h2>

        <p> <h1>Risotto ingredients </h1>
        <ul> 
            <li> 6 cups low-sodium chicken stock, or vegetable stock</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li> 1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
            <li> 1 lb shiitake mushroom(455 g), stemmed and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>  2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li> 2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon fresh thyme, finely chopped</li>
            <li>  salt, to taste</li>
            <li>  pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>  1 ½ cups arborio rice(200 g)</li>
            <li>  ½ cup white wine(120 mL)</li>
            <li>  1 cup grated parmesan cheese(110 g), plus more for serving</li>
            <li> ¼ cup fresh parsley(10 g), for serving</li> </ul> </p>

     <p><h1>Steps </h1> </p>

            <p> <ol>
            <li> Add the stock to a medium pot and bring to a boil over high heat. 
                Once the stock is boiling, reduce the heat to low or remove the pan from the heat and keep nearby. </li>
                              
            <li>
                Heat the olive oil in a wide, tall pot over medium heat. 
                Once the oil begins to shimmer, add the shallot and cook, stirring frequently, until translucent.
            </li>


            <li> 
            Add the shiitake mushrooms and butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have cooked down.
             Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, stir, and cook for 1 minute, until the butter has melted and the garlic is aromatic. </li>
               
            
             <li> Add the rice and stir until fully coated in the mushroom mixture. Let the rice toast for 1-2 minutes, until fragrant.
                    Add the white wine and cook until the wine has evaporated, stirring occasionally. </li> 
                
              <li>
                    Add 1 cup (240 ml) of the hot stock and stir to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, until the stock is fully absorbed.
                    Continue to add the stock, ½ cup (120 ml) at a time, stirring continuously, until the broth is fully absorbed, for 15-20 minutes. Depending on how fast the rice cooks, there may be leftover stock.
             </li>
            
              <li> Once the rice is al dente, remove from the heat. Add the Parmesan and stir to combine.
                    Top with parsley, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.
                    Enjoy! </li> </ol> </p>
